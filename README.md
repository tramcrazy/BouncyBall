# BouncyBall

A libGDX based graphics demo that I created during my first week of graphics programming work in A-level Computer Science. Releases can be found in the other repo, [BouncyBallReleases](https://github.com/tramcrazy/BouncyBallReleases). This is just so that GitHub Pages plays more nicely.
